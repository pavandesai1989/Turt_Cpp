MyClass a;
MyClass b;
b = MyClass(10);

Question: Which functions are called here?

A) Only copy constructor
B) Only copy assignment operator
C) Copy constructor then copy assignment operator
D) Default constructor only

Answer: C) Copy constructor then copy assignment operator ✅

Explanation:

MyClass(10) creates a temporary object → copy constructor may be called (or move constructor in modern C++).

Then, this temporary is assigned to b → copy assignment operator is called.

MyClass a;
MyClass b(a);

Question: Which function is called?

A) Default constructor
B) Copy constructor
C) Copy assignment operator
D) Destructor

Answer: B) Copy constructor ✅

Explanation:

Object b is being created and initialized from a.


MyClass foo() {
    MyClass temp;
    return temp;
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj = foo();
}

Question: Which function is called to initialize obj?

A) Default constructor
B) Copy constructor
C) Copy assignment operator
D) Depends on compiler optimizations

Answer: D) Depends on compiler optimizations (NRVO / RVO) ✅

Explanation:

Normally, copy constructor is called when returning by value.

Modern compilers often apply Return Value Optimization (RVO) → may skip the copy.


int main() {
    MyClass a;
    MyClass b;
    b = a;
}

Question: Which function is called when b = a; executes?

A) Default constructor
B) Copy constructor
C) Copy assignment operator
D) Destructor

Answer: C) Copy assignment operator ✅

Explanation:

b already exists, so this is assignment, not initialization.

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {}
    MyClass(const MyClass& obj) { /* copy constructor */ }
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& obj) { /* copy assignment */ return *this; }
};

int main() {
    MyClass a;
    MyClass b = a;
}

Question: Which function is called to initialize b?

A) Default constructor
B) Copy constructor
C) Copy assignment operator
D) Destructor

Answer: B) Copy constructor ✅

Explanation:

b is being initialized at the time of creation.

Copy assignment is used only after an object already exists.
